Abstract:
   Large sky surveys provide numerous non-targeted observations of small bodies
  of the Solar System. The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of
  the Vera C. Rubin observatory will be the largest source of small body
  photometry in the next decade. With non-coordinated epochs of observation,
  colors, and therefore taxonomy and composition, can only be computed by
  comparing absolute magnitudes obtained in each filter by solving the phase
  function (evolution of brightness of the small body against the solar phase
  angle). Current models in use in the community (HG, HG12* , HG1G2) however
  fail to reproduce the long-term photometry of many targets due to the change
  in aspect angle between apparitions. We aim at deriving a generic yet
  simple phase function model accounting for the variable geometry of the small
  bodies over multiple apparitions. As a spinoff of the HG1 G2 model,
  we propose the sHG1 G2 phase function model in which we introduce a term
  describing the brightness changes due to spin orientation and polar
  oblateness. We apply this new model to 13,245,908 observations of 122,675
  SSOs. These observations were acquired in the g and r filters with the Zwicky
  Transient Facility between 2019/11/01 and 2023/12/01. We retrieve them and
  implement the new sHG1 G2 model in Fink, a broker of alerts designed for the
  LSST. The sHG1 G2 model leads to smaller residuals than other phase
  function models, providing a better description of the photometry of
  asteroids. We determine the absolute magnitude H and phase function
  coefficients (G1 , G2 ) in each filter, the spin orientation (α0 , δ0 ), and
  the polar-to-equatorial oblateness R for 95,593 Solar System Objects (SSOs),
  which constitutes about a tenfold increase in the number of characterized
  objects compared to current census. The application of the sHG1
  G2 model on ZTF alert data using the FINK broker shows that the model is
  appropriate to extract physical properties of asteroids from multi-band and
  sparse photometry, such as the forthcoming LSST survey.
