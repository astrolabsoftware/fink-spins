## Exploration of spins

Before to run the notebooks, look the README of the 'fink_utils' folder.

This folder contains a number of notebooks:

- desc_spin_distance

Illustrate the distance to a coordinate on the celestial sphere (so aspect angle), used in the s function of the sHG1G2

- desc_new_phase_model

Illustrate the different parts (f, g, s) of the sHG1G2 model 


## Proposal for improvements
- [ ] Consistency of parameters in and out
  - alpha0, delta0 are radians in, degrees out

- [ ] Renaming of parameters/functions
  - spin_angle -> aspect_angle
  - Homogeneise ra/alpha, dec/delta, ...
  - naming convention with longer and explicit names
